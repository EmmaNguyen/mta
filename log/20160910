- Download a set a turnsile
- Do EDA with Graphlab

- Observation:
  - Have not seen any interesting things here,
  just a couple of very basic analysis
  - Not really clear data is

- Next Action:
  - Spend 30 more minutes to clean and analyse data
  - Download 3 more data set and do the same thing to
  see whether there is any common pattern between these
  things

- Reading (60 min):
  - Data Science in Business
  - Free reading in 30 minutes


- Stupid comments:
  - I see this is a kind of practicing pandas and numpy and
  learn graphlab rather than really analyze data.

  - Spend 30 more minutes to clean and analyze data
  - Download 3 more data set and do the same thing to

  things

- Plan:
  - Download three more turnsile sets
  - Do EDA with Graphlab

- Observations:
  - Period of time: 4 weeks

- Next action:
  - Continue to clean data
  - Do some more visualizations: 10 (perhaps)
  - Do some common model

- Comments:
  - Need more time to understand data


## 8:15-9:15pm, 10 Sept 2016

- Reading (60 min):
  - Data Science in Business
  - Free reading in 30 minutes > fine time-series-reading (local computer - 15 links/books/articles/courses)

- Non-sense Comments:
  - Why do I fall in love with Math? Why are sources I've
  found are all stuffs with bunches of formula?

- Next Action:
  - To make sure about memory, re-read and continue to summarize "Data Science in Business"
  - Come back to "ISLR" and "Element of Statistics"
