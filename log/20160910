- Download a set a turnsile
- Do EDA with Graphlab

- Observation:
  - Have not seen any interesting things here,
  just a couple of very basic analysis
  - Not really clear data is


- Next Action:
  - Spend 30 more minutes to clean and analyse data
  - Download 3 more data set and do the same thing to
  see whether there is any common pattern between these
  things

- Reading (60 min):
  - Data Science in Business
  - Free reading in 30 minutes


- Stupid comments:
  - I see this is a kind of pratice pandas and numpy and
  learn graphlab rather than really analyze data.
